Gesture Recognition using Mediapipe and OpenCV
This project is a real-time gesture recognition system that utilizes the Mediapipe library for pose detection and OpenCV for image processing.

Overview
The application detects the angle between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist of both the left and right arms. Based on these angles, it recognizes and counts specific gestures (raising the arm up and bringing it down).

Features
Real-time gesture recognition
Displaying the number of recognized gestures
